# NeoVim Shared Config

## Todo

-   [ ] Remap focused bindings to use LocalLeader instead of multiple keys
-   [ ] Check it worth using img-clip.nvim: copy/paste/drag images
    -   https://github.com/HakonHarnes/img-clip.nvim
    -   It was added as Dep from Avante, monitor if I use it
-   [ ] Monitor Kulala ls and fmt to see if it is worth to use it
    -   https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1fy979o/kulala_language_server_v1_released/
-   [ ] Monitor nvrh - vscode like remote access
-   [ ] Monitor magazine.nvim - nvim-cmp fork - as cmp seems to be slow on development
    -   https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1fxkknj/nvrh_aims_to_be_similar_to_vscode_remote_but_for/
-   [ ] Try to auto fold JS/TS imports
    -   https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/seq0q1/comment/hulbcew/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
-   [ ] Idea: local history plugin: there is one, but it uses python, it should be pure lua
-   [ ] Check which_key and add descriptions to keys that have `+prefix`
    -   [ ] It's possible to fix WhichKey prefixes without descriptions by setting a keybind with empty right-hand side
-   [ ] git - list only local branches, it's listing all branches including not mine ones
-   [ ] Bookmarks: code a way of having different named list of files by changing the project_path
        Grapple calls it "scopes"
        like: bookmarksPath .. project_path .. "-permanent-list" .. ".json", or bookmarksPath .. project_path .. "-ticket-XX-yyy-" .. ".json"
-   [x] Make `]d` and `[d` ignore typos, aka `info`
-   [x] Install multi-line plugin
        https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi
        I installed, it's amazing, but seems slow on multiple cursors
-   [x] Clean up unused plugins
-   [x] Add emmet plugin (maybe not, I just need wrap and unwrap)
    -   I ended up using https://github.com/olrtg/emmet-language-server
    -   Its a single package and gives full emmet support via LSP and display via CMP
-   [ ] Create my Own Cheat Sheet of commands and remaps
-   [ ] Add my surround config from VSCode for markdown bold, inline-code, etc
    -   this might need an attach function to the markdown file-type only
-   [ ] Keep an eye on UFO - to better fold code
-   [x] Lua line git branch - show current cwd instead of current file
    -   I don't think it worth it, given the amount of code to write
    -   this is causing branch to not be visible when editing special files
    -   https://github.com/kevinhwang91/nvim-ufo
-   [x] maybe test Avante.nvim to replace Copilot? https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim
-   [x] Enums shows white and blue depending on where they are, TS and TSX
-   [x] Add oil.nvim to test if it is better than neo-tree
    -   it is good to use in the current folder, but navigating seems daunting
-   [x] review and lazy load plugins
-   [x] Enable some plugins only locally not on SSH connections
-   [x] Add my most used snippets from VSCode, like `cl` for console.log
-   [x] Try to use cspell with a plugin instead of native nvim spell
-   [x] `this` in TS is not highlighted as a keyword, how PHP is handling it using treesitter?
-   [x] Setup debugger for Chrome
-   [x] Setup debugger for node-terminal
-   [x] hide the dapui_console window
-   [x] update the `ff` command to ignore more folders, it's too slow now
-   [x] Add custom code to preview images in Telescope
    -   https://github.com/3rd/image.nvim/issues/183#issuecomment-2284979815
-   [x] Check nesting config for Neo Tree
-   [x] setup lua formatter with sane defaults to projects without a RC file
    -   apparently the CLI doesn't accept format arguments
-   [x] Fork the Dashboard and change file name to omit the CWD and show only relative path
    -   here: https://github.com/nvimdev/dashboard-nvim/blob/63df28409d940f9cac0a925df09d3dc369db9841/lua/dashboard/theme/hyper.lua#L190
    -   I created a PR https://github.com/nvimdev/dashboard-nvim/pull/416, ðŸ¤ž
    -   If it gets merged, I'll suggest to start the index with `0`, same as `0
-   [x] Correct the sign background color, it is too dark on the numbers column
-   [x] Add `jk` to send `<Esc>` in all modes, as saw everywhere on the internet
    -   it is terribly slow, I'm disabling it for now
-   [x] `@function.call.tsx` should have higher priority over type
-   [x] use `try_node_modules` with the Formatter plugin
-   [x] How to Format PHP with prettier?
-   [x] adjust diffView ctrl+ b / f to scroll less, it jumps too much
-   [x] Use quickfix to show TSC errors
    -   https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/ylvoml/typescript_errors_into_vim_quickfix/
    -   I need to find a way to look for the nearest tsconfig.json and run tsc on it
-   [x] Check if Telescope cache can have ignore, so I can re-enable ui-select
    -   It doesn't, I disabled the ui-select plugin for now to avoid issues
-   [x] add a width limit to notify and word-wrap
-   [x] Add plugin to auto pair brackets
-   [x] Review highlights for `.editorconfig`, it is too blue
-   [x] `@type.tsx` shows as white in DiffView, should be blue as a normal type
-   [x] Change Telescope mapping `<M-q>` to something else, as it is already mapped to `<Esc`>
    -   it is to send only selection to the quickfix list, `<C-q>` sends everything
-   [x] Check if I need to use a local TSServer or if it is smart enough to pick up the one from the open project
    -   and I can check https://github.com/pmizio/typescript-tools.nvim
-   [x] Make Kitty's default title only the current directory
-   [x] Learn how to use quickfix
    -   [x] map `[q` and `]q` to navigate through errors
-   [x] Compare the plugin vimspector with the DAP plugin [name](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector)
    -   VimSpector seems to be more mature, but DAP seems to be the future, I'm skipping this for now
-   [x] Install plugin `trouble` to show errors and warnings
-   [x] Disable float term
-   [x] Install toggle terminal plugin (I have the float-term, but I would prefer to have them in a split)
    -   [x] no, it cant: Or maybe Kitty can open a new terminal in the same CWD?
    -   [x] lea https://github.com/skywind3000/asynctasks.vimrn more about the Toggle term functionality
    -   [x] check the async tasks plugin https://github.com/skywind3000/asynctasks.vim
        -   seems to much to learn its syntax, I'll skip it for now
-   [x] make `null` and `true`, and `false` highlight as normal blue types
-   [x] How to auto-complete search command? `/ `
    -   It was just a missing config on nvim-cmp
-   [x] Syntax highlight for `*.md` files and my Darcula config
-   [x] Maybe I should start my own Darcula theme repository? it seems to much to keep overriding stuff, and other plugins highlights are not working properly
    -   It was just a matter of not using `Normal`, because it was adding a black background to everything, `NormalFg` is good
